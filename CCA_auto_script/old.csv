Residents of Gundriposi observed that outsiders are coming to their forest and indscriminately destroying the forest. The village started discussing about the ways of protecting the forest. They got motivation from the volunteers of CACD. They also got inspired from forest protection committees of the neighbouring village. Eventually in 1997, they constituted an informal forest protection group and named it Padmanabha Jubak Sangh.

Gundriposi was once a thick jungle. This place was accidentaly found by a trio while wandering in the jungle. It was a large plain area, suitable for cultivation on the opposite banks of the river. Initially, only three familly settled here but slowly it became a small village. Since Gunduri Chadhei (Partridge) was found abundantly in the forest hence, the village was named as Gunduriposi. It is situated in Harischandrapur block of Keonjhar district, dominated mostly by Santhal tribe. Then the king issued them with the settlement pattta (RoR).

In those initial days, no committee was formed to look after the affairs of the forest.

The Jharan is a natural water spring arising at the foothills of the mountain. Although the place of origin falls within the boundary of Madhya Pradesh, The 'Jharan' flows down into the boundary of Jhargaon. It is a big asset for the people as it provides adequate water for irrigation even during the lean season.
The water sharing is basically done on rotational basis. However, this primarily depends on the number of households which are extensively engaged in agriculture that year. If the number is more then the water is shared in a more logical way. The water is allowed to flow from 7 am to 12 noon. Rest of the time the flow is checked  when the water is allowed to be stored in a pond adjoining to the Jharan. When it is 
released the pressure is high initially. Hence the water flows to a longer distance and it is allowed to irrigate the far off fields. This is allowed till 10 am after that the water is diverted to the nearby fields. The responsibility of stopping the flow lies with the person whose turn falls on the next day. Any dispute regarding the sharing of water is settled by the hamlet committee, which consists of the ward members and the leaders.",ST+SC+OBC,100,450,,"During 1970-71 for the first time, 60 households who were members of the forest protection group gave the informal institution of forest protection a formal structure. They selected 11 member for the Executive committee, which was represented by people of all castes but dominated by Kulitas. The second attempt to protect the forest was made in 1981 and a new committee was formed by the youth of the village. They had started keeping rough written records that were also not very systematic. Things got more systematised in 1986 with the intervention of FD. The forester asked them to maintain their records properly. In 1990, the forest department formed the Forest Protection Committee with the then existing members. 

Jhargaon in pre-independence period was a part of Chandarpur Zamindari estate under Thakur Birendra Singh. During the Zamindari period, the village was given 159.60 acres of forestland for their use and management which had the status of 'Gochar'(grazing land). Under major settlement in 1976, it was designated the status of Khesra forest. Other forest areas surrounding the village were kept reserved by the Zamindar, which in later years was declared as Protected Reserve Forest. The Naka (Forest guard) was appointed by the Zamindar, looked after the other Zamindari jungle. Proper management and use of the gochar land over the years has led to development of good forest cover. According to the people, the forest was so dense and good and due to low anthropogenic pressure, they were able to meet all their demands from the forest given to them. Other people who used to take wood to make plough from the Zamindari forest had to pay 20 annas per plough and this had risen to Rs. 3.00 by the time.

Other than the forest resources, the villagers have evolved an elaborate system for managing the  village commons. These management practices are believed to be as old as the village itself.",,,"In 1981, the villagers introduced the Palli system in which a stick was kept in the evening at the doorstep of the person who has to go patrolling the next day.

If for some reason the person assigned patrolling duty is unable to go, he has to ask someone else to go in his place or else he is fined which is a day’s wages at the prevailing rate. 3. If the person does not inform the next patrolling member regarding his turn for the next day and he fails to turn up for the patrolling work, then the former person is fined. 4. Families unable to go for patrolling for e.g., widow HHs or older persons, contribute by hiring a labour/get the help of their relatives or send male children. 5.
